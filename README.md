# Hyper-API-and-Youtube-Scraping

### The HyperAPI_Youtube *Scraping_PublishtoTableauServer.py* script is structured in three main parts:
#### 1. Use the Youtube API to extract information on the most popular Data science and Data engineering videos
#### 2. Push the output to a .hyper file so that it can be open straight in Tableau in two ways
     2a. Each table is pushed to a single hyper file
     2b. The two tables are combined in a single hyper file with multiple tables 
#### 3. Push the hyper files to Tableau Server as Published DataSources so they can be accessed both from Tableau Server and Desktop for analysis.
